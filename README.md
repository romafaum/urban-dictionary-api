# Unoficial Urban Dictionary API
## Description:
This project use web scraping(beutiful soup) to collect data from Urban Dictionary(and only once internal urban dictionary api to get all likes and dislikes) and throw it to Django Rest API endpoints
On this moment API has 3 route:
  - To get deffinitions by name
  - Get definitions by author
  - Get random definions
If I ever continue should add:
  - limitation to definitions, if them too many API become too slow
  - Ordering by likes or date on choise
  - And looking for specific content within definitions
